#CTM TECHNICAL TEST

To run the test cases, Chromedriver is required
The technology I have used to automate test cases is Selenium as it is an open source tool which supports different languages like Java, JavaScript, c#, Ruby etc.
Apache Maven is a software project management and a comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a Page Object Model, Maven can manage a projectâ€™s build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.
I have used Maven dependencies to form all the all the libraries which helps to run the test cases.
Created a Page Object Model framework which helps to hold all the functionalities and its pages.
